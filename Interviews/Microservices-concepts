✅ 1. Microservices Fundamentals

Definition & Principles

What is a microservice?

Why microservices over monoliths?

Characteristics: Independent deployability, scalability, decentralized governance, fault isolation


Monolith vs Microservices

Pros and cons of each

When to use what


Bounded Context (Domain-Driven Design)

Understanding subdomains and context mapping


Loose Coupling & High Cohesion

Service independence, minimizing dependencies

Designing for modularity




---

✅ 2. Service Decomposition Strategies

By Business Capability

By Subdomain (DDD)

Avoiding "Entity Service" Anti-Pattern

Understanding Aggregate Roots



---

✅ 3. Inter-Service Communication

Synchronous Communication

REST over HTTP

gRPC (when to use, advantages)


Asynchronous Communication

Message Brokers: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, AWS SQS/SNS

Event-Driven Architecture: Event producers and consumers

Message formats: JSON, Avro, Protobuf




---

✅ 4. API Gateway

Responsibilities

Request routing

Authentication & Authorization

Rate limiting

Response aggregation


Technologies

Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul

NGINX, Kong, Ambassador




---

✅ 5. Service Discovery

Client-side vs Server-side

Tools

Netflix Eureka

Consul

Kubernetes DNS-based discovery




---

✅ 6. Configuration Management

Centralized Config

Spring Cloud Config Server

HashiCorp Consul/etcd


Environment Profiles

Per-environment config: dev, test, prod




---

✅ 7. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

Retry Mechanisms

What to retry: transient errors only

Tools: Spring Retry, Resilience4j

Backoff strategies: fixed, exponential, jitter


Timeouts

Avoid waiting forever on slow services

Configure timeouts for all network calls


Circuit Breaker

Open, Half-Open, Closed states

Tools: Resilience4j, Hystrix (deprecated)


Fallback Mechanism

Fallback logic for failed dependencies

Static fallback response or alternate service


Bulkhead Pattern

Isolate failures in one service/component

Thread pools per dependency


Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse/throttling

Tools: Bucket4j, API Gateway Rate Limiter




---

✅ 8. Data Management

Database per Service

Avoid shared schema

Foreign key restrictions in distributed systems


Eventual Consistency

Accepting temporary data staleness

Use case-driven consistency decisions


Saga Pattern

Orchestration (central service directs)

Choreography (services listen to events)


Event Sourcing

Store state as a sequence of events

Replayable event log


CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Split read and write models

Use projections for queries




---

✅ 9. Security

OAuth2 Basics

Authorization code flow

Password grant (deprecated for public clients)


JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Claims, expiration, signature

Stateless authentication


API Gateway Authentication

Central auth and request forwarding


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

User roles and permissions


Service-to-Service Authentication

Mutual TLS (mTLS)

API keys, signed tokens




---

✅ 10. Observability

Logging

Centralized logging using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Log correlation with trace IDs


Tracing

Distributed tracing with Zipkin, Jaeger

Trace ID propagation


Metrics

Application metrics with Micrometer

Prometheus + Grafana for visualization


Health Checks

Spring Boot Actuator /health

Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes




---

✅ 11. Deployment and Infrastructure

Containerization

Dockerfile basics

Multi-stage builds


Orchestration

Kubernetes concepts: Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets

Helm Charts for packaging services


Service Mesh (Advanced)

Sidecars, Istio, Linkerd basics


CI/CD

Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

Build-test-deploy pipelines




---

✅ 12. Testing Microservices

Unit Testing

Mockito, JUnit


Integration Testing

Spring Boot Test, Testcontainers


Contract Testing

Consumer-driven contracts with Pact


End-to-End Testing

Postman/Newman, Selenium




---

✅ 13. Versioning and Compatibility

API Versioning Strategies

URL versioning (/v1/resource)

Header versioning


Backward Compatibility

Schema evolution for messages (Kafka + Avro)

Avoid breaking changes




---

✅ 14. Common Interview Scenarios

Design an e-commerce system using microservices

Handle payment and order flow using Sagas

Logging and debugging in distributed systems

Circuit breaker behavior under failure

Eventual consistency handling in inventory updates

Designing for failure and fallback



---

✅ 15. Advanced Concepts (Optional but Valuable)

Domain-Driven Design in-depth (Aggregates, Value Objects, Repositories)

Blue-Green and Canary Deployments

Chaos Engineering: Injecting failures

Trunk-Based Development vs GitFlow

Feature Toggles & Dark Launches

Sidecar pattern, Ambassador pattern
